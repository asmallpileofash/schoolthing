    <h1>Welcome to my horrible website! ❤️</h1>
    <p>
      This website is mainly complaining about Google and alternatives to non-open source products. Also google is bad! Did you know google is bad? I think google is really bad. You should use duckduckgo.

    <p>
      I like software that is free, and open source as implied by the previous paragraph.

      Google is very bad because of their policies about privicy because they can use any data that you put on it to their advantage such as selling it for their econimical gain.
